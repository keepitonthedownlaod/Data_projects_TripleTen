# OilyGiant Oil Well Profitability & Risk Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes the potential profitability and associated risks of drilling new oil wells in three different regions. Using machine learning and statistical bootstrapping, I built and evaluated predictive models to estimate oil reserves and identify the most promising location for investment.

This project was completed as part of the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp.

## 🧠 Objective
Help OilyGiant make an informed business decision by:
- Predicting the volume of oil reserves in each region.
- Calculating the expected profit.
- Assessing the risk of financial loss using the bootstrapping technique.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Linear Regression
- Bootstrapping (for risk analysis)
- Business condition modeling

## 📁 Files Included
- `oilygiant_profitability.ipynb` – Main analysis notebook
- `geo_data_0.csv`, `geo_data_1.csv`, `geo_data_2.csv` – Datasets for the three regions
- `README.md` – This file

---

## 💡 Key Findings
- Built and trained linear regression models for each region.
- Calculated profit per well and total regional profit.
- Identified the region with the best balance of high profit and low risk.
- Used bootstrapping to estimate the probability of financial loss.

## ✅ Conclusion
Based on predictive modeling and simulated risk, **Region X** (replace with your result) was selected as the most profitable and stable option for oil well development, meeting the company’s business constraints and risk tolerance thresholds.
