# Beta Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict customer churn for Beta Bank using classification techniques. The main focus is on handling class imbalance and improving performance through evaluation metrics like F1-score and ROC-AUC.

## 📊 Objective
Help the bank identify customers at risk of leaving so that targeted retention strategies can be implemented.

## 🔍 Key Tasks
- Performed exploratory data analysis on customer demographics and bank behavior.
- Preprocessed data, addressed missing values, and scaled features.
- Applied Random Forest and Logistic Regression classifiers.
- Handled class imbalance using upsampling and class weighting.
- Evaluated model using F1-score, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

## 📁 Files
- `BETA BANK CHURN PROJECT.ipynb` — Full analysis and model training.
- `Churn.csv` — Original dataset.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- `Pandas`, `NumPy`
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- `Scikit-learn`

## 🚀 Outcome
Achieved an F1-score exceeding the project benchmark of 0.59 and validated model performance on a separate test set.
