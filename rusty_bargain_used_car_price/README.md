# Rusty Bargain Used Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of used cars based on their specifications and historical sales data. The insights help Rusty Bargain optimize pricing and buying decisions.

## Objective
- Train and evaluate regression models
- Compare performance and efficiency across algorithms
- Identify features most relevant to pricing

## Dataset
- Includes data on vehicle type, registration year, power, mileage, fuel type, brand, and actual selling price.

## Key Tasks
- Cleaned and preprocessed data (handled outliers, encoded categorical features)
- Compared models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- Tuned hyperparameters to improve RMSE

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

## Results
- Best model achieved a low RMSE on test data
- Identified vehicle age, mileage, and power as key price predictors

## Conclusion
The final model provides a robust solution for predicting used car prices, enabling smarter inventory and pricing strategies for Rusty Bargain.
