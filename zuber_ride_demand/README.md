# Zuber Ride Demand Patterns in Chicago

## Overview
This project explores ride demand patterns for Zuber, a ride-sharing company operating in Chicago. The goal was to analyze taxi usage between the Loop and O'Hare International Airport and examine how ride frequency is influenced by weather conditions.

## Objective
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify demand patterns in different weather conditions
- Test hypotheses about ride counts
- Support decision-making for marketing and operations

## Dataset
- **rides.csv**: Contains taxi trip data, including pickup/dropoff locations and timestamps.
- **weather.csv**: Weather data with temperature, wind, and precipitation.

## Key Tasks
- Cleaned and merged datasets
- Visualized ride trends by time, day, and weather condition
- Hypothesis testing on average rides during different weather types

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
- Found significant patterns in ride frequency based on weather
- Visuals and statistics supported the decision-making process

## Conclusion
The findings help Zuber better understand demand fluctuations, enabling improved driver allocation and customer targeting based on external weather data.
